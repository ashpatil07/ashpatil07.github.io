## CASE STUDIES

### Case Study 1: Singapore General Hospital (SGH)-Remote Patient Monitoring

#### Overview:

* Singapore General Hospital (SGH) implemented an innovative remote patient monitoring system using AI cameras and big data analytics to enhance patient care. The project aimed to extend medical surveillance beyond hospital walls, enabling continuous monitoring of patients recovering at home.

#### Implementation:

* AI cameras equipped with sensors were installed in the homes of post-surgery patients. These cameras captured vital signs, movements, and other relevant health data. The collected data was then processed using advanced big data analytics tools. The analytics platform identified patterns indicative of potential complications, allowing healthcare professionals to intervene promptly.

#### Results:

* The implementation significantly reduced readmission rates and improved patient outcomes. Through continuous monitoring and data-driven alerts, SGH achieved a proactive approach to patient care. The integration of big data analytics ensured that healthcare providers could prioritize interventions based on real-time data, ultimately enhancing the quality of care for patients recovering outside the hospital.

### Case Study 2: The Climate Corporation's FieldView Platform

#### Overview:

* The Climate Corporation, a subsidiary of Bayer, has developed the FieldView platform, leveraging IoT to provide comprehensive data-driven insights for farmers.

#### Implementation:

* FieldView integrates IoT sensors, weather data, and satellite imagery to offer farmers a holistic view of their fields. Sensors placed in the field collect data on soil health, temperature, and moisture levels. This data is combined with external factors like weather forecasts and satellite imagery to create a detailed field-level analysis. Farmers can access this information through the FieldView app, allowing them to make data-driven decisions on crop management, resource allocation, and risk mitigation.

#### Results:

* Farmers using The Climate Corporation’s FieldView platform have reported improved decision-making and enhanced yields. The platform’s data-driven insights help farmers optimize planting patterns, irrigation schedules, and input usage. Additionally, FieldView contributes to sustainability efforts by promoting precision agriculture practices, reducing environmental impact, and maximizing the efficiency of farming operations. The success of FieldView showcases the transformative impact of IoT on modern agriculture
