<h2>FAQ's</h2>
<p><strong>Q1:</strong> Do I need to register my copyright to protect my work?</p>
<p>While copyright protection exists automatically upon the creation of your work, registering your copyright provides additional legal benefits, including the ability to pursue statutory damages and attorney's fees in case of infringement.</p>

<p><strong>Q2:</strong>  How long does copyright protection last?</p>
<p>In general, copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years. However, this duration may vary depending on factors such as the type of work and the date of creation or publication.</p>

<p><strong>Q3:</strong> Can I copyright my ideas?</p>
<p>Copyright law protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. To receive copyright protection, your ideas must be fixed in a tangible form, such as a written document, artwork, or recording.</p>
